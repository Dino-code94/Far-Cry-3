            <h2>About Far Cry 3 game</h2>
            <p>
                FaR Cry 3 is an open-world first-person shooter that was developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by
                Ubisoft.
                It was released on November 29, 2012 for Australia, November 30, 2012 for the Republic of Ireland and
                Europe,
                and December 2, 2012 for North America (December 4 in Canada) for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Microsoft
                Windows.
                A new edition of Far Cry 3 titled Far Cry 3 Classic Edition,
                was released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on June 26, 2018.
                It is the third main title in the Far Cry series,
                and its story takes place some time after the events of Far Cry 2.
                Despite this, the game is not a direct sequel to it or the original Far Cry.

                Far Cry 3 is set on a tropical Asian-Pacific archipelago called the Rook Islands.
                The game's protagonist is a young American man named Jason Brody
                who is trying to save his imprisoned friends and escape the hostile islands after a vacation gone wrong.
                He gets involved with the Rakyat, the native people of the island, and in return for their assistance,
                sets out to help them reclaim the island from Vaas Montenegro's pirate and Hoyt Volker's privateer
                invaders.</p>
            <p class="spaced">
                The game also features a competitive multiplayer mode,
                a map designer for multiplayer, and for the first time in a Far Cry game, a 2 - 4 player cooperative
                campaign.
