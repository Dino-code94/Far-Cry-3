            <h2>About Far Cry 3 game</h2>
            <p>
                FaR Cry 3 is an open-world first-person shooter that was developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by
                Ubisoft.
                It was released on November 29, 2012 for Australia, November 30, 2012 for the Republic of Ireland and
                Europe,
                and December 2, 2012 for North America (December 4 in Canada) for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Microsoft
                Windows.
                A new edition of Far Cry 3 titled Far Cry 3 Classic Edition,
                was released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on June 26, 2018.
                It is the third main title in the Far Cry series,
                and its story takes place some time after the events of Far Cry 2.
                Despite this, the game is not a direct sequel to it or the original Far Cry.

                Far Cry 3 is set on a tropical Asian-Pacific archipelago called the Rook Islands.
                The game's protagonist is a young American man named Jason Brody
                who is trying to save his imprisoned friends and escape the hostile islands after a vacation gone wrong.
                He gets involved with the Rakyat, the native people of the island, and in return for their assistance,
                sets out to help them reclaim the island from Vaas Montenegro's pirate and Hoyt Volker's privateer
                invaders.</p>
            <p class="spaced">
                The game also features a competitive multiplayer mode,
                a map designer for multiplayer, and for the first time in a Far Cry game, a 2 - 4 player cooperative
                campaign.

            <h2>Plot</h2>
            <p>
                The game starts with a cinematic showing protagonist Jason Brody on vacation with a group of friends in
                Bangkok celebrating Jason's younger brother Riley on getting a pilot license. As part of the vacation
                they decide to take a skydiving trip. They land on a pirate-infested island, and are taken prisoner by a
                pirate lord named Vaas. Vaas plans to extort ransom money from their parents, then sell them into
                slavery. With the help of his older brother Grant, Jason breaks out of captivity, but Grant is killed by
                Vaas in the escape. Jason is rescued by a man named Dennis, who is part of the Rakyat, the island
                natives who suffer due to the activities of the pirates. Dennis recognizes Jason's potential as a
                warrior, and gives him the tatau, the tattoos of a Rakyat warrior. Jason then helps the Rakyat in a
                number of missions and ends up finding one of his friends, Daisy, at the house of Dr. Earnhardt.
                Impressed with Jason's prowess, the Rakyat allow him to be the second outsider to enter their sacred
                temple (Dennis was the first being born in Liberia) and their leader Citra initiates him into the tribe
                after Jason finds and returns the Silver Dragon knife, a Rakyat relic, having seen it in a previous
                dream. He runs a series of missions during which he rescues his captive friends Keith, Oliver, and
                Jason's girlfriend Liza while simultaneously helping the Rakyat retake their island, helped at times by
                Dr. Earnhardt and Willis Huntley, a CIA agent. After a few run-ins with Vaas, Jason discovers that he is
                employed by Hoyt Volker, a slave trader and that Vaas is Citra's brother. Throughout the adventure,
                Jason matures into a fearsome warrior and is revered by the Rakyat, begins to enjoy all the killing, and
                grows more distant from his friends, especially after receiving the information that Riley is dead.
                After Citra asks him to stay in the island, Jason returns to Dr. Earnhardt's house, where his friends
                are hiding and preparing their escape by boat, and tells them that he is staying, completely distant
                from his friends and family, leaving them disturbed. Afterwards, Citra drugs Jason and has sex with him
                while he is in a hallucination.

                Jason and Riley arrive at the Rakyat Temple. Jason asks Citra why his friends were captured, but she
                sprays him with a sleep powder, and Jason falls unconscious, while Riley is captured. Citra has fallen
                in love with Jason, believing him to be a powerful warrior of Rakyat legend, and that she will free him.
                He starts dreaming of walking a fiery path, with the Dragon Knife, and having Liza as a monster in his
                dream. He wakes up holding Liza at knife point with the Dragon Knife, and the player is given the choice
                either to kill Jason's friends or to spare them.

            <p class="spaced">
                If the player chooses to kill his friends, Jason will slit Liza's throat and then have sex with Citra in
                a ritual. Jason, however, gets stabbed in the chest by Citra, who says that their child will lead the
                Rakyat to glory. As Jason is nearing death, Citra says "You won". If the player instead chooses to spare
                his friends, Jason will stop the ritual and free his friends, telling the Rakyat and Citra that he is
                done with killing. As Citra begs him to stay in the island, Dennis is outraged for what he considers an
                insult by Jason, and tries to stab him, only for Citra to stand in the way. As Citra lies bleeding in
                Jason's arms, she begs him to stay. She dies, and Dennis falls to the ground, not believing what he did.
                Jason and his friends are seen leaving the island by boat, with Jason narrating that despite becoming a
                monster from all the killing, he still believes that in some place in his heart he is still better than
                this. The game ends with a still image of the boat and the Dragon Knife in the beach while the credits
                roll.
